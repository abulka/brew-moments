## How it works

Accurately calculate how much water you need for a given amount of coffee, in order to maintain a brew ratio. Ratios range from 1:2 (expresso) to 1:16 (typical V60) and higher.

Optionally save your "moments" as favourites, together with grind information and notes.

## Screenshots

Play with the sliders or click the up/down buttons for more fine grained control:

I might do an iOS version if there is enough interest.
